**2025 Laser Power Optimization System**

Justin Lee

This system was developed as my "research" over six weeks in summer 2025.
Work was done in the "instrumentation" division of Brookhaven National Laboratory.

This alignment system is designed for use with laser to fiberoptic cable coupling.
Uses a sensitive photodiode to detect the amount of light coming through, of which, the power is then converted to voltage to create an analog signal for the ADC to then create a measurement.
Requires manual alignment prior to use as the system is not designed to automatically couple from a point of no signal, only optimize coupled power.
